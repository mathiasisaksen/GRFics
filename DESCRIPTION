Title: Efficient generation of noise functions from approximate
        Gaussian random fields

Description: GRFics is an R library for efficient generation and interpolation of noise functions generated from two-dimensional Gaussian random fields (GRFs). This is done using a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) approximation based on a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). A periodic boundary condition is used, leading to noise functions that are periodic along the vertical and horizontal boundaries.
