Description: This package generates approximate realizations a Gaussian random field (GRF).
    This is done using a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) approximation based on a 
    stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). A periodic boundary condition is used,
    leading to realizations that are periodic along the vertical and horizontal boundaries.
